## Deep Q-Network: ELI5

Deep Q-Network (DQN) is like a smart kid playing a video game. Imagine you are playing Super Mario and every time you make a move, you get a score. The goal of DQN is to make the best moves (actions) for the highest score possible. Just like how you learn from your mistakes, DQN learns from its past experiences (reinforcement learning) to figure out the best moves to make in a given situation. It does this by using a neural network to approximate the value function of each possible action.

The Deep Q-Network algorithm helps in making the best decision (action) by maximizing the score that can be achieved in a given state. It is a type of deep learning technique that can be used in reinforcement learning to make optimal decisions in complex environments.

DQN has been successfully used in various applications, such as playing Atari games, controlling robots, and managing traffic flow. With its ability to approximate the value function of each possible action, DQN has proven to be a powerful tool for solving complex decision-making problems.

If you are interested in learning more about the algorithm, it is important to have a good understanding of reinforcement learning and neural networks.

In short, DQN uses a neural network to help make optimal decisions in complicated situations by learning and approximating the value of each possible action. [Deep Q Network](https://serp.ai/deep-q-network/)
