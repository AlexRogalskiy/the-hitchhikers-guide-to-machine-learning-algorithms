    # Load the breast cancer dataset
    data = load_breast_cancer()
    X = data.data
    y = data.target
    
    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
    
    # Convert the training and testing data to LightGBM datasets
    train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)
    test_data = lgb.Dataset(X_test, label=y_test)
    
    # Set the hyperparameters for the LightGBM model
    params = {
        'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
