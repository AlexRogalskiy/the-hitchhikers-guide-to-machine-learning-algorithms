# Understanding Gradient Boosted Regression Trees: Definition, Explanations,
Examples & Code

The Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), also known as Gradient Boosting
Machine (GBM), is an ensemble machine learning technique used for regression
problems.

This algorithm combines the predictions of multiple decision trees, where each
subsequent tree improves the errors of the previous tree. The GBRT algorithm
is a supervised learning method, where a model learns to predict an outcome
variable from labeled training data.

Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), also known as Gradient Boosting
Machines (GBM), is an ensemble machine learning technique primarily used for
regression problems. As an ensemble method, GBRT combines the predictions of
multiple decision trees to produce a more accurate and robust model.

GBRT falls under the category of supervised learning, which means it requires
a labeled dataset to learn from. The algorithm works by building decision
trees in a sequential manner, where each subsequent tree corrects the errors
made by the previous tree. This process is repeated until the model achieves a
desired accuracy or convergence.

GBRT has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to handle
complex non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, as
well as its flexibility in handling different types of data such as numerical,
categorical, and binary. In addition, GBRT has proven to be a powerful tool
for feature selection, providing insights into the importance of different
features in predicting the target variable.

GBRT has become a widely used algorithm in many applications, including
finance, healthcare, and marketing. Its ability to handle large datasets and
its high level of interpretability make it a valuable tool for data scientists
and machine learning engineers.

## Gradient Boosted Regression Trees: Use Cases & Examples

Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) is an ensemble machine learning
technique for regression problems. It combines the predictions of multiple
decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

GBRT has been successfully applied in many industries, including:

  * Finance: predicting stock prices, credit scoring, and fraud detection
  * Marketing: customer segmentation, targeted advertising, and churn prediction
  * Healthcare: disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient outcome prediction
  * Transportation: traffic prediction, route optimization, and demand forecasting

One example of GBRT in action is in the financial industry, where it has been
used to predict stock prices. By analyzing historical stock data, GBRT can
identify patterns and make predictions about future stock prices. This
information is valuable for investors and traders, who can use it to make
informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.

Another example is in healthcare, where GBRT has been used to predict patient
outcomes. By analyzing patient data such as medical history, symptoms, and
test results, GBRT can predict the likelihood of a patient developing a
particular disease or experiencing a particular outcome. This information can
be used by doctors and healthcare providers to make treatment decisions and
improve patient outcomes.

## Getting Started

Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) is an ensemble machine learning
technique for regression problems. It combines the predictions of multiple
decision trees to improve the accuracy of the model. GBRT is a supervised
learning method and is commonly used in various fields, including finance,
healthcare, and marketing.

To get started with GBRT, you will need to have a basic understanding of

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Predict on test data
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

## Gradient Boosted Regression Trees: ELI5

Imagine you are lost in a huge forest and you need to find your way back home.
You have a map that shows you the way but not the exact location of your home.
You start walking in the direction you think is correct. After a while, you
realize that you are not moving towards home and you find yourself off track.
You consult the map again and adjust your direction, and continue walking. You
check the map repeatedly, and each time you make an adjustment until you
finally find your way back home.

This is similar to how Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) works. It is a
machine learning technique for regression problems that combines the
predictions of multiple decision trees. Each tree represents a map, and the
algorithm attempts to make predictions by fitting to the data similar to how
one would adjust their direction based on the map. The first tree may not give
a correct prediction, but the algorithm adjusts its calculation and combines
the second tree with the first, hoping to present a better estimate. The
algorithm continues in this manner, combining each subsequent tree with the
earlier ones until the best prediction is found.

GBRT is an ensemble learning method, meaning it combines multiple models to
achieve better accuracy. It is a supervised learning method, where it learns
from labelled data to make predictions on new data.

So by using GBRT, we can accurately predict an outcome, by iteratively
combining multiple decision trees, adjusting its prediction each time, just as
we would adjust our direction walking in the forest with a map.

GBRT is a complex algorithm, but it has proven to be very powerful in solving
real-world problems.
