Nadam is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning that combines the Adam optimization algorithm with Nesterov accelerated gradient. It is considered an extension of the Adam algorithm, as it also uses adaptive learning rates and momentum. Nadam is a popular choice for optimizing neural networks and has been shown to converge faster than other optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adagrad, and RMSprop.

The name Nadam is derived from the combination of two words: Nesterov and Adam. Nesterov accelerated gradient is a method for updating the parameters in a neural network that adds a momentum term to the gradient descent update. The Adam algorithm, on the other hand, uses a combination of the first and second moments of the gradient to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. By combining these two methods, Nadam is able to achieve faster convergence and better optimization performance.

As an optimizer, Nadam falls under the category of gradient-based optimization methods, which are commonly used in deep learning. It is particularly useful for training deep neural networks, which often have many parameters and require a lot of computational resources to optimize. Nadam also supports parallelization, making it an efficient choice for large-scale distributed training.

In general, when choosing an optimizer for a machine learning model, it is important to consider factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the computational resources available. Nadam is a powerful optimization algorithm that can help improve the training speed and performance of neural networks, and is worth considering for many machine learning applications.

## Nadam: ELI5

Imagine you are playing a game of Marco Polo in a swimming pool. You are blindfolded and searching for your friends, calling out "Marco" and listening for their response of "Polo." As you move closer to them, their voice gets louder and clearer, so you can adjust your direction and find them faster.

Nadam is like a game of Marco Polo between the optimizer and the loss function. The optimizer is searching for the minimum point of the loss function, and Nadam helps it get there faster. It combines two other algorithms - Adam and Nesterov accelerated gradient - to do this.

Adam is like a swimmer who is constantly adjusting their speed and direction based on the changing water conditions, trying to get to their goal as efficiently as possible. Nesterov accelerated gradient is like a swimmer who has memorized the layout of the pool and can anticipate where they will need to adjust their direction to get to the finish line faster.

Nadam combines these two approaches to help the optimizer adjust its direction and speed more efficiently towards the minimum point of the loss function, getting to its goal faster and with less splashing around.

So, in simple terms, Nadam is an optimizer that helps machine learning algorithms find the best solution to a problem more quickly and efficiently.
