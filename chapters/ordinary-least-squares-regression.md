# Understanding Ordinary Least Squares Regression: Definition, Explanations,
Examples & Code

The Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR) is a regression algorithm used in
supervised learning. It is a type of linear least squares method utilized for
estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. As a
regression algorithm, OLSR is used to predict continuous numerical values. It
is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, engineering,
and social sciences, to analyze the relationship between variables and to make
predictions based on that relationship.

Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR) is a widely used algorithm in the
field of regression. As a type of linear least squares method, it is
particularly useful for estimating unknown parameters in a linear regression
model. This algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning, which
means that it requires labeled data to train the model.

With OLSR, the goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the
observed values in the dataset and the values predicted by the linear
approximation. This is achieved by adjusting the coefficients of the linear
equation until the optimal values are found.

OLS regression is a popular choice for simple linear regression, as it gives
reliable and interpretable results. It is also widely used in multiple linear
regression, where there are multiple independent variables involved.

For machine learning engineers and data scientists, OLSR is a valuable tool
for predicting numerical outcomes based on other variables in the dataset. Its
simplicity and accuracy make it a reliable choice for regression problems in
various fields.

## Ordinary Least Squares Regression: Use Cases & Examples

Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR) is a type of linear least squares
method used for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression
model. It is a popular regression algorithm used in supervised learning.

One of the main use cases of OLSR is in predicting housing prices. By using
OLSR, we can estimate the relationship between various factors such as the
size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the location with the price of
the house. This information can be used by real estate agents or potential
buyers to make informed decisions.

Another use case for OLSR is in financial analysis, such as predicting stock
prices. By using OLSR, we can estimate the relationship between various
factors such as the company's financials, industry trends, and market
sentiment with the stock price. This information can be used by investors to
make informed decisions about buying or selling a particular stock.

OLS Regression is also used in medical research, such as predicting the risk
of heart disease. By using OLSR, we can estimate the relationship between
various factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and lifestyle
with the risk of heart disease. This information can be used by doctors to
make informed decisions about patient care and treatment options.

Lastly, OLSR is used in marketing research, such as predicting consumer
behavior. By using OLSR, we can estimate the relationship between various
factors such as demographics, purchasing history, and product preferences with
consumer behavior. This information can be used by businesses to make informed
decisions about marketing strategies and product development.

## Getting Started

Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR) is a type of linear least squares
method used for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression
model. It is a popular regression algorithm used in supervised learning.

To get started with OLSR, you will need to have a basic understanding of
linear regression and the mathematical concepts involved. Once you have a
grasp of these concepts, you can start implementing OLSR using Python and
various machine learning libraries.

    
    
    
    import numpy as np
    import torch
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    
    # create some sample data
    X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
    y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3
    
    # fit the model using numpy
    beta_numpy = np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(y)
    
    # fit the model using pytorch
    X_torch = torch.from_numpy(X)
    y_torch = torch.from_numpy(y)
    beta_torch = torch.linalg.lstsq(X_torch, y_torch).solution.numpy()
    
    # fit the model using scikit-learn
    reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
    beta_sklearn = np.append(reg.intercept_, reg.coef_)
    
    print("Beta using numpy: ", beta_numpy)
    print("Beta using pytorch: ", beta_torch)
    print("Beta using scikit-learn: ", beta_sklearn)

Imagine you are a cookie factory and you need to figure out how much of each
ingredient (flour, sugar, eggs, etc.) to use to make the perfect batch of
cookies. You have some data on past batches and their ingredient amounts and
how good they ended up being. Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR) is like
a recipe calculator that takes in that past data and helps you figure out the
perfect balance of ingredients to use for future batches of cookies.

In technical terms, OLSR is a type of linear least squares method used in
regression analysis to estimate the unknown parameters in a linear regression
model. It falls under the category of Supervised Learning, meaning it learns
from labeled examples that provide both the input and the desired output.

More concretely, OLSR aims to find the line that best fits a set of data
points in a way that minimizes the distance between the line and the points in
the vertical direction. By finding this line of best fit, OLSR can help us
predict future outcomes based on past data.

For example, if we have data on the price of a house based on its square
footage, we can use OLSR to find the line that best fits that data and then
predict the price of a new house given its square footage.

So, OLSR is like a recipe calculator for finding the best fit line that can
help us predict future outcomes based on past data.
