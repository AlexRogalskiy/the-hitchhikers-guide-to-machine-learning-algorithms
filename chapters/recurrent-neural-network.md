Code

The Recurrent Neural Network, also known as RNN, is a type of Deep Learning algorithm. It is characterized by its ability to form directed graph connections between nodes along a sequence, which allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. RNN has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to handle sequential data of varying lengths. RNN can be trained using both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning methods.

RNN is widely used in various applications, some of which include:

1\. Language translation: RNN is used in language translation applications to translate one language into another. It is capable of understanding the context of a sentence and translating it into another language while maintaining the context and meaning of the sentence.

2\. Speech recognition: RNN is used in speech recognition applications to convert speech into text. It is capable of understanding the context of a sentence and converting it into text while maintaining the context and meaning of the sentence.

3\. Image captioning: RNN is used in image captioning applications to generate captions for images. It is capable of understanding the content of an image and generating captions that describe the image.

4\. Stock prediction: RNN is used in stock prediction applications to predict the future prices of stocks. It is capable of analyzing historical data and predicting the future prices of stocks with high accuracy.

## Getting Started

To get started with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), you first need to understand what it is and how it works. RNN is a type of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a sequence, allowing it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. This means that RNN can process sequences of inputs, such as time series data or natural language, and make predictions based on the patterns it learns from the sequence.

One popular application of RNN is in natural language processing, where it can be used for tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition. To get started with RNN, you can use Python and popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

## Recurrent Neural Network: ELI5

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is like a time traveler that can predict what's going to happen next. Imagine watching a movie but being able to pause it at any time and ask someone what they think will happen next. That someone is an RNN.

Like any other neural network, RNNs learn from examples. But what sets them apart is that they can remember what they've learned from the past and use it to influence what they predict will happen next. So for example, if in our movie there's a good guy and a bad guy, an RNN could use past examples to predict whether the good guy will defeat the bad guy or not.

It does this by creating connections between nodes in a sequence, forming a directed graph. This allows the RNN to capture a sequence of inputs and the dependencies between them. It's like taking a book and reading it one word at a time, but always remembering the words that came before and after each one.

RNNs use supervised or unsupervised learning methods to train themselves to make better predictions. This means they can learn from labeled or unlabeled data and make predictions based on what they've learned.

RNNs have many applications, from predicting stock prices to generating new text. They excel at tasks where context and the order of inputs matter.
