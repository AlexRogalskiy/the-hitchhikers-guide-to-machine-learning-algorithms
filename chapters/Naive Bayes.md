# Understanding Naive Bayes: Definition, Explanations, Examples & Code

Naive Bayes is a **Bayesian** algorithm used in **supervised learning** to
classify data. It is a simple probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes'
theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.

Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm used in machine learning for classification
tasks. It is a simple probabilistic classifier that is based on applying
Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. This
algorithm falls under the Bayesian type of machine learning and is commonly
used for supervised learning tasks.

## Naive Bayes: Use Cases & Examples

Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes'
theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. It is a
Bayesian algorithm that falls under the category of supervised learning.

One of the most popular use cases of Naive Bayes is in spam filtering. The
algorithm can be trained using a dataset of emails that are labeled as spam or
not spam. Once trained, it can classify new emails as spam or not spam with
high accuracy.

Another use case of Naive Bayes is in sentiment analysis. The algorithm can be
trained to recognize patterns in text that indicate positive or negative
sentiment. This can be useful for analyzing customer reviews or social media
posts.

Naive Bayes can also be used in document classification. The algorithm can be
trained on a dataset of documents labeled by topic, such as sports, politics,
or technology. Once trained, it can classify new documents based on their
content.

Lastly, Naive Bayes can be used in medical diagnosis. The algorithm can be
trained on a dataset of patient data labeled with different diseases or
conditions. Once trained, it can assist doctors in diagnosing new patients
based on their symptoms and medical history.

## Getting Started

Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes'
theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. It is a
type of Bayesian algorithm and is commonly used in supervised learning.

To get started with Naive Bayes, you can use Python and common machine
learning libraries like NumPy, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Here's an example of
how to implement Naive Bayes using scikit-learn:

    
    
    
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
    
    # create some dummy data
    X = np.array([[-1,-1],[-2,-1],[-3,-2],[1,1],[2,1],[3,2]])
    Y = np.array([1,1,1,2,2,2])
    
    # create a Naive Bayes classifier
    clf = GaussianNB()
    
    # train the classifier on the data
    clf.fit(X,Y)
    
    # predict some new data
    print(clf.predict([[-0.8,-1]]))

## Naive Bayes: ELI5

Naive Bayes is like a treasure-seeking pirate who uses a map to navigate
through the unknown waters of data. The algorithm helps predict which path the
pirate should sail by analyzing past experiences and the probability of
finding treasure in certain areas, similar to how Naive Bayes calculates the
probability of a particular data point belonging to a certain class. The
algorithm applies Bayes' theorem, a logical rule that calculates how likely an
event is based on prior knowledge, to classify new data based on strong
assumptions of feature independence. Naive Bayes falls into the category of
Bayesian algorithms, which use a probabilistic approach to make predictions
based on prior observations. The algorithm only requires labeled data to learn
from, therefore making it a supervised learning method.
