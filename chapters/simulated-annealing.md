# Understanding Simulated Annealing: Definition, Explanations, Examples & Code

Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing
process in metallurgy, which involves heating and controlled cooling of a
material. It is used to find the global optimum in a large search space. It
uses a random search strategy that accepts new solutions, even those worse
than the current solution, based on a probability that decreases as the
metaphorical 'temperature' decreases. This ability to accept worse solutions
occasionally can help the algorithm escape local minima and move towards
finding a global minimum.

Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm used to find the global
optimum in a large search space. It is inspired by the annealing process in
metallurgy, which involves heating and controlled cooling of a material. It is
a type of optimization algorithm falling under the optimization category of
machine learning methods.

The algorithm uses a random search strategy that accepts new solutions, even
those worse than the current solution, based on a probability that decreases
as the metaphorical 'temperature' decreases. This ability to accept worse
solutions occasionally can help the algorithm escape local minima and move
towards finding a global minimum. Simulated Annealing has been used in a
variety of applications, including neural network optimization, VLSI design,
and job scheduling, among others.

Simulated Annealing is a powerful optimization algorithm that can be used in a
variety of applications where finding the global minimum is a necessity. Its
ability to escape local minima and its versatility make it a popular choice
among machine learning practitioners.

Unlike some optimization algorithms that can become trapped in a local
minimum, Simulated Annealing allows for exploration of the search space in a
controlled manner, which can aid in finding the global minimum. This algorithm
is a valuable tool in the field of machine learning and optimization.

One use case of Simulated Annealing is in the field of logistics. It can be
used to optimize the delivery routes for a company with multiple destinations
and limited resources. By using Simulated Annealing, the algorithm can find
the most efficient route to deliver all the packages, considering factors such
as distance, traffic, and delivery time.

Another use case of Simulated Annealing is in the field of finance. It can be
used to optimize investment portfolios by finding the combination of
investments that will yield the highest return while minimizing risk.
Simulated Annealing can consider various factors such as asset class,
historical performance, and market trends to find the optimal portfolio.

Simulated Annealing can also be used in the field of engineering to optimize
the design of complex systems. For example, it can be used to optimize the
shape of an airplane wing to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency.
Simulated Annealing can consider various design parameters such as wing
length, width, and curvature to find the optimal design.

Lastly, Simulated Annealing can be used in the field of machine learning to
optimize the hyperparameters of a model. Hyperparameters are parameters that
are set before the training of the model and can greatly affect the
performance of the model. Simulated Annealing can be used to find the optimal
values for these hyperparameters, such as learning rate and regularization
strength, to improve model performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with Simulated Annealing, you will need to follow these steps:

  1. Define the problem you want to solve and the objective function that you want to optimize.
  2. Choose an initial solution to the problem.
  3. Set the initial temperature and cooling schedule parameters.
  4. Iteratively generate new candidate solutions by perturbing the current solution and accepting or rejecting them based on the probability function.
  5. Stop the algorithm when the stopping criteria are met (e.g., maximum number of iterations or convergence to a satisfactory solution).

Here is an example implementation of Simulated Annealing in Python using NumPy
and SciPy libraries:

    
    
    
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.optimize import minimize
    
    def objective(x):
        return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2
    
    def simulated_annealing(objective, x0, bounds, T0=1.0, alpha=0.95, maxiter=1000):
        x = x0
        T = T0
        for i in range(maxiter):
            # Generate a new candidate solution by perturbing the current solution
            x_new = x + np.random.normal(size=x.shape)
            # Clip the candidate solution to the feasible region
            x_new = np.clip(x_new, bounds[:, 0], bounds[:, 1])
            # Evaluate the objective function at the candidate solution
            f_new = objective(x_new)
            # Calculate the change in objective function
            delta_f = f_new - objective(x)
            # Accept or reject the candidate solution based on the probability function
            if delta_f < 0 or np.exp(-delta_f/T) > np.random.uniform():
                x = x_new
            # Update the temperature
            T *= alpha
        return x
    
    # Define the problem and the initial solution
    x0 = np.array([1.0, 1.0])
    bounds = np.array([[-5.0, 5.0], [-5.0, 5.0]])
    
    # Run the algorithm
    x_opt = simulated_annealing(objective, x0, bounds)
    
    # Print the optimal solution
    print("Optimal solution:", x_opt)

## Simulated Annealing: ELI5

Simulated Annealing is like a treasure hunter trying to find the biggest pile
of gold by wandering through a huge maze of caves. They start off moving
randomly but as they keep going, they get smarter and start wandering towards
the brightest spots of gold that they see.

But sometimes, the best solution might not be in front of them. They might
have to take a step back and explore a different path that looks less
promising, just in case it leads them to an even bigger pile of gold in the
long run. Think of it like moving from a hot room to a cooler room. It might
be a few degrees hotter in the next room, but it's worth exploring if it gets
cooler as they go along.

Simulated Annealing works in much the same way. It starts with a solution and
then randomly tries different solutions nearby. If the new solution is better,
it replaces the old solution. But if it's worse, it might still be accepted
based on a probability that decreases over time, like the temperature of the
treasure hunter's environment. This means that the algorithm has a chance to
escape from local minima and keep exploring until it finds the global minimum.

So in essence, Simulated Annealing is a method of exploring a large search
space by initially moving randomly and gradually refining its path towards the
optimal solution, while also allowing for occasional exploration of non-
optimal paths in hopes of finding an even better solution.

It's like searching for the best path in a maze, until you finally reach the
end.
